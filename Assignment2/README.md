# Directives for this assignment

The assignment consists on the prediction of grayscale images of letters P - Z.

The data can be loaded as follows:
```
import pickle
x_train = pickle.load(open("x_train.obj","rb"))
x_test = pickle.load(open("x_test.obj","rb"))
y_train = pickle.load(open("y_train.obj","rb"))
```

The provided data comprises the training set that can be used for the training (and for the validation) and the unlabelled balanced test set.

In order to be evaluated, each student should submit (strictly before the deadline) a zip file named Nome_Cognome_Matricola_assignment2.zip containing all and only:

- the source code;
- a brief PDF report (max 2/3 pages) reporting: <br>
  1. The resolution of the problem of supervised classification with a traditional neural network (convolutional layers should not be used) with some motivations about the choices on data processing, number and dimension of the layers, optimization algorithms and regularization (this time mandatory), and some comments about the results (as seen in class). 
  2. The developement of a simple auto-encoder model, investigating visually  the reconstruction abilities of such an architecture, i.e. comparison of the input and the output (reconstructed input) (as seen in class).
  3. (optional) The use and evaluation of the encoded representation generated by the auto-encoder to solve the problem of supervised classification. <br>
- (optional) a txt file named Nome_Cognome_Matricola_score2.txt, where each line corresponds to the prediction (a number between 16 and 26 that corresponds to P-Z letters) of the instances of the test set. The file should contain only one column and with no header.

As an alternative to [source code + report], you can submit a whole jupyter notebook containing the equivalent information content (code + the required report in text cells).
